Codes I used for reproducing ChIP-Seq data analysis from a published research paper

I reproduced figures from a published research paper by following a tutorial by Dr. Ming “Tommy” Tang. Here, I reproduced the figures from a study titled “Genome-wide association between YAP/TAZ/TEAD and AP-1 at enhancers drives oncogenic growth”, conducted by Zanconato et al. in Italy back in 2015, which unravels how different protein groups team up to control gene activity in cancer cells.
